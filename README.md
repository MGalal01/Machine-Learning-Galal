ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Forecasting with LSTM ðŸ“ˆ
This project demonstrates how to retrieve stock price data for top corporations from Yahoo Finance, preprocess the data into a time series format suitable for training, and use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to forecast future stock prices.
This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to building a stock price forecasting model using LSTM. The model uses historical stock price data to predict future prices, helping investors make informed decisions.
